In my portion of the project, I sought to understand how these metrics were produced. While many of these variables are propriatary and cannot be accessed with an API call, some of them are not.

Adding and removing variables in the absense of theory or hypotheses is NOT best practice, and it is not a reliable way to learn about the data. I do not intend this to be a serious model of Spotify's \"danceability\" variable, This is just a fun exercise. \n",

Disappointingly, every variable made the cut.  The final R-squared value on this was greater than we achieved in our final model for \"energy\" above. This model explains approximately 68% of the variance in song energy. The only variable which had an unreasonable standard error in this model was song duration. Next, I tried forward stepwise regression with every linear variable at the same confidence level, and the results were exactly the same. "

This brought the R-squared value to 0.6964; just shy of 70% of the variance explained. I really wanted to push that number to 0.7, so I tried generating more quadratic terms to throw into the model, but all to no avail; they either had multicolinearity issues and threw up impossibly large standard errors, or else they were statistically significant but did not impact overall model-fit. Given this limited dataset, I feel confident that I achieved the \"best fitting model\" (quantitatively, but not substantively!) that I could possibly achieve.
