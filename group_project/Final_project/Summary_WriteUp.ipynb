Our team sought to explore this question by looking at the Spotify API and comparing the qualities of a sampling of songs from each genre. By examining how the traits of songs, like popularity and various \"audio features\", differ between genres, people can gain a better understanding of how a genre can suit specific tastes."

Some of these scatterplots are too close to each other to discern a unique relationship clearly, but others are very distinct in terms of their overall levels of danceability and the strength of the curve.\n",
